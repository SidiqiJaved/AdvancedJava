Super Keyword:

super is a keyword like "this" keyword, but it refers to the parent class object.
we can use the super keyword in 3 different ways.

1). to access the super class variables if we have the same name variables in super
class and base class.

2). If we have same method names in parent and child class we can use the super keyword
to access the parent class method otherwise by default java referes
to the child class  methods.

3). As constructors dont participte in inheritance we can super () to call
the constructors from the parent class.

Rules:

1. IF we have a constructor in the parent class that takes two arugments we must
have the constructor inside the child class that at least takes two arguments.

2. We cant use this() and super () inside the same constructor

3. super can not be used in static method
static belongs to the class not object
