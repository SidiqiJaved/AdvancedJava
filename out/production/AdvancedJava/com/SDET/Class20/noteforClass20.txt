What is Inheritance ?

It is a mechnanism in java through which a child class get the properties and methods
 a parent class


Benifits of Inhritance:

1. it saves time to code
2. code duplocation is reduced
3. execuation time is faster

distavanatage of Inheritance:

Classes are tightly coupled if we change something in parent class it is also changed
in child class

Types of Inheritnace

there are 4 types of inheritance but java only supports 3 of them


1. signle
2. Hieririchical
3. Multilevel
4. multiple ( not supported by java)


1. Single Inheritance :
In single we only have one child and one parent class
or only two classes participting in inheritance

Class Parent {
}
class Child extends Parent {

}

2. Hierarchical Inheritance

We have a single parent class and mulitiple child class

Class Parent {

}
Class Child1 extends Parent {

}
Class child2 extends Parent{

}


3. Multilevel

We have mulitple levels of inheritance for example if we have classes A B C
 class C will be inherited from B and B will be inherited from A

 Class A{

 }
Class B extends A{

}
Class C extends B{

}

=====================================

Super KeyWords
super keywords is like  " this " it refers to the parent class object
for example we can access the field method or constructor or parent class iside the
child class saving this word
