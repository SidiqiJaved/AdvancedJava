Constructors in Java,

Construtors in Java are special block of code similar to methods
that initialize the objects of a class

Rule:

1. they dont have return type not even void
2. Name of the Construstors must be same as name of the class
3. Constructors cant have non access modifiers like static final etc.
4. We can use the access modfieres like public private protecrted with constructors
5. if we dont write constructor in the a class a default constructors is providers
by compliers
6. We can have mutliple construtors in the class but theri numbers of arugemtns sequence of arugemtns  or
type of arguments should be different .
7. If we have mulitiple construtors then Java decide which constructor to call base on the
paramaters.

this Keyword.

it is a reserved keyword in Java that we can use to refer to instance variables method
or consturcotrs of the a class.

1. "this" keyword is used to distinguish isntant variables with local variables.
2. we can use "this keyword " to call consturctprs of a class inside another constructors
3. We can use the " ths" keyword to call the method inside a consturtor

Rules:
1)." this "() should be the first line insdie a consturtor
2). "this" cant be used inside the method
